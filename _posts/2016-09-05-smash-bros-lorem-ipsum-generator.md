title: Smash Bros Lorem Ipsum Generator
---


I couldn't sleep last night so I started working on a project I had been meaning to hack together - a Smash Bros lorem ipsum generator.

It took about five hours - according to the commit logs - so that's not so bad. 


# Content
The current lexis is lists of characters, stages, and items from Smash 64, Melee, and Brawl. Once I add PM and Smash 4, I'll throw in relevant content for each game such as combos, commentary highlights, or dank memes.

# Tech
This might change at a moment's notice, but it's currently built using:

* Materialize.css
* jQuery
* Node.js
* Heroku

React might get added since I plan to add filtering options and it would be a good learning experience.


# Conclusion

Check it out the project [here](https://smashipsum.herokuapp.com) and the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/disregardingstandards/smashipsum).
