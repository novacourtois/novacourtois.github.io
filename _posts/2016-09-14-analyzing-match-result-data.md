title: Analyzing Match Result Data
---

How is anybody supposed to get better at something, specially Super Smash Bros Melee - arguably the most technically demanding fighting game ever, without the occasional shut-up-and-look-at-the-data realization that an outside, unbiased perspective can help you improve your performance?

# The Issue

Unfortunately, the best game ever was released too early. Nobody - not even the game's developers - were aware of so many unintentional glitches and abusable game mechanics that would breed a competitive scene of dedicated button-pushers. 

Being run on a Nintendo GameCube, SSBM doesn't have any (usable) statistics or data analysis that would help foster and improve a competitive gamer's level.

A couple of years ago, I made a Chrome Extesion that extends CraigsList's functionality.

I decided to update it to remove a bunch of external dependencies, and make a nice landing page for the app as well. 

# Fixing Old Code

When I first made this, I was using jQuery for everything, and [Toastr](https://codeseven.github.io/toastr/) seemed to make itself useful as well.

Frameworks are better for everything, right?

Well, sometimes the best tool for the job is [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/), and you should check it out sometime. 

It "is a fast, lightweight, cross-platform framework for building incredible, powerful JavaScript applications."

It required rewriting most of the code, but it was totally worth it, and it loads much quicker. I also wrote a simple pure css notification system for it that's much lighter than Toastr.

As far as bugs go, there was some issue with counting how many new posts there were, but that off-by-one error went away with the rewrite.
