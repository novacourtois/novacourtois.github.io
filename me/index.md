Hello, my name is Nova Courtois. My pronouns are they / them. I am a programmer, like figuring stuff out, and enjoy words.

# What do you do?
Besides working on projects, I play Super Smash Bros Melee for the Nintendo GameCube competitively.

I also like going to poetry slams, solving rubiks cubes, and thrifting. 

# What do you usually code?
Lately, it's been a lot of AngularJS apps, with Mongo and Node if necessary. 

Python's great and I used to be really into Django.

Hardware stuff is cool too - I once automated my apartment restroom to play classical music when 'occupied' so that nobody can listen to you.
